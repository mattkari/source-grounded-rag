# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Source-Grounded Scholarly Research and Literature Reviews

A research prototype investigating whether Retrieval-Augmented Generation can support scholarly
research and literature reviews while reducing — and helping researchers detect — AI-generated
hallucination. The system is a **scholarly research assistant, not a general-purpose chatbot**: it
answers questions using evidence retrieved from an authorised research collection (initially one
doctoral thesis by Melih Sönmez and one selected academic article, English only), preserves
attribution and qualification, presents disagreement rather than resolving it, labels its own
interpretation as interpretation, and provides citations traceable to a specific page. Its central
commitment is **source-grounded refusal**: when the collection does not contain sufficient evidence,
the system says so instead of filling the gap from general model knowledge. The AI analyses; the
researcher decides.

The corpus is intentionally small for a conference demonstration, but the architecture is
corpus-agnostic — another researcher should be able to replace the documents with a different
scholar's thesis, articles, books, or policy documents without rewriting the core RAG pipeline.

**Full architecture and implementation plan:** [`docs/plans/PLAN_V2.md`](docs/plans/PLAN_V2.md)

**Status:** Planning complete. No application code has been written yet. Sprint 1 awaits human approval.
